# ReactJs Example App

Application to work with some of the key features of React.

## Installation guide

The application was created using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md) as it is recommended by the [react documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html).

```
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app react-example-app

cd react-example-app
npm start
```
In the case of our application I added a couple of extras dependencies:

- [sass](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#adding-a-css-preprocessor-sass-less-etc)
- [bootstrap](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#adding-bootstrap)
- [npm-run-all](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#adding-a-css-preprocessor-sass-less-etc)


I have follow the [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md) documentation to add this dependencies and modified the scripts section of the packages.json file as the documentation recommends.
